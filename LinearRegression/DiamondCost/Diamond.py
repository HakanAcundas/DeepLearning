"""IMPORTANT NOTES: First I changed the data type string to INT. Cut 1-5, Color type is 1 or 2(On internet I saw 
D-E-F is colorless class, and G-H-I-J are near colorless (Colorless = 1, NearColorless = 2). Second I decided the 
price column by 1000 because I got an error that values are too large(18.823 = 18823). Also I erase some NONE(Empty) 
lines and columns. In excel sheet I Sorted from small to large. That's why when in the console you can see only 
higher values. """
